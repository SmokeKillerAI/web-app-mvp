## Development philosophy
- Ship the simplest thing that demonstrates value.
- Do not over-engineering at current stage, focus on implementing the core functionality and features.
- Avoid O(n²) algos on unbounded inputs
- Reasonable DB indexes, avoid unnecessary indexes
- Invest early in security, auth, and data model clarity—those rewrites hurt the most.
